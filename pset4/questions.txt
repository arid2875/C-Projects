0.  BMP supports 32 bit color, GIF suppors 8 bits, JPEG supports 24 bits, and PNG supports 24 bits
1.  GIF supports annimation
2.  lossless formats retain all of their information when compressed. lossy formation lose some of their information when compressed.
3.  GIFs are lossless, BMP are lossless, PNG are lossless, JPEG is lossy
4.  When a file is deleted from a FAT file system the system removes it's pointer to the deleted file information and releases the block of memory used to store the deleted info for future use
5.  In order to ensure that deleted data cannot be recovered a user can physcially destroy the drive, or overwrite all of the drives memeory blocks with null or random ASCII data
6.  Stdint.h is a header file containing the integer types in c. including long, long long, unsigned, char, etc.
7.  These data types provide optimum memory usage for certain applications, such as ones where negative numbers aren't to be used.
8.  BYTE is one byte, DWord is 4 bytes, long is 4 bytes, and word is 2 bytes.   
9.  The first two bytes of any BMP file are the Chars BM.
10. bfSize is the size of the file and bi is the size of the bitmap data structrue.
11. if biHeight is negative then the bitmap is top-down oriented.
12. The color depth is specified by the field biBitCount.
13. If the user does not enter a valid output file name, fopen could return NULL.
14. Because we are always reading in one element of data (BITMAPINFOHEADER).
15. Padding is assigned to all bi.biWidth that are not even multiples of 4. (i.e bi.biwidth % != 0)
16. Fseek allows us the change the location of a file pointer.
17. SEEK_CUR is the current location of the file pointer.
